Bodies so putrid even the crows died from consuming their rotten flesh lined the streets. A man could only walk streets like that so many times before he started to go mad. Nikos was afraid he was about to reach that breaking point. But, the physician forced himself to persevere.

There was nothing Nikos could do to save him now.\n\n“If you please, could you go fetch your husband some clean water to drink.? We do not want him drinking from the bath,” Nikos told Eleni.

    "periclesTextDescription": "Although the point of democracy was that the citizen body of Athens at large decided upon their political fate, the democratic system was still dominated by certain individuals. The most famous of these is Pericles, the man Thucydides described as the “first citizen of Athens” (H.P.W, 2.65). Pericles was a general, a statesman, and an orator, and effectively led the Athenian state during its Golden Age, between the Persian and the Peloponnesian Wars (c. 461 to 429 BC).\n\n He was responsible for overseeing much of the cultural embellishment of Athens which has helped bolster its historical reputation. It was under his supervision that the ambitious building project atop the city’s Acropolis, including the Parthenon, was carried out. Pericles had also ordered the famous long walls of Athens to be rebuilt to protect the city and its harbour (the Piraeus). Many of these building projects were funded by the treasury of the Delian League, increasing tensions between Athens and her ostensible allies (really, they were effectively subjects).Pericles’ reputation in history is as a powerful orator and a champion of the democratic principles of the Athens he knew. However, because of his control of Athenian politics at this time, some have labelled Pericles a demagogue or a populist. Demagoguery, the manipulation of people (often derisively referred to as the ‘mob’) is one of the oldest criticisms of democracy as a form of politics.The most famous of Pericles’ speeches is the ‘Funeral Oration’ recorded by Thucydides, in which the Athenian statesman commemorated those who had died in the first year of the Peloponnesian War, as well as the glory of Athens and her democracy.“I have dwelt upon the greatness of Athens because I want to show you that we are contending for a higher prize than those who enjoy none of these privileges... Make them your examples, and, esteeming courage to be freedom and freedom to be happiness, do not weigh too nicely the perils of war.” (Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War)Pericles’ own funeral would not be long in arriving. He would lose his life to the plague that devastated his city in 429 BC.A bust of Pericles, a Roman marble copy of a Greek original from c.430BC, now in the Museo Pio-Clementino in the Vatican",

    "thucydidesTextDescription": "Along with Herodotus, Thucydides is often labelled as the “Father of History”. He was an Athenian general who lived between c.460 and 400 BC and is most well known for his History of the Peloponnesian War, the account of the war between Athens and Sparta. Although he was slightly later than Herodotus, whose Histories describe the Persian Wars, Thucydides historical methods are more scientific: he aspires to a level of impartiality and evidence (beyond the gods) that is not always evident in Herodotus’ work… Thucydides’ narrative of the Peloponnesian War begins in 431 BC and it ends in 411 BC, with the crushing Athenian defeat at Syracuse in Sicily. Although it misses the final years of the war (which ended in 404), it is a precious source for historians and archaeologists. He was, as he writes, a firsthand witness to the struggles of his age: he fought in the war, contracted the plague (but survived), and was even exiled from his city! As a result, Thucydides is the primary source we have for the plague. The historian gives an evocative account of the devastation the pestilence wrought on the Athenians, whilst his descriptions have helped historians establish what the disease may have been. “The nature of the disease was beyond description, and the sufferings that it brought to each victim were greater than human nature can bear… So the Athenians had fallen into the great misfortune and were being ground down by it” (Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War)",

    "socratesAndPlatoTextDescription": "Athens’ Golden Age was the time of some of the most important philosophers in European history. The two most well-known are certainty Socrates (c.470-399), and his student Plato (c.428-348).Much of what is known about Socrates today is filtered through the dialogues of Plato, in which Socrates is the central character (more of an antagonist, in the sense that his constant questioning of the Athenian citizens must have stretched patience quite thin sometimes!). Because of this, what exactly Socrates taught to the people of Athens is something of a mystery; we are presented with a Socrates as presented by Plato, and to a slightly lesser extent, the historian Xenophon.Socrates’ early life might strike many as quite surprising for a philosopher; he was a distinguished soldier, serving the Athenian army and even saving the life of the General Alcibiades at the Battle of Potidaea in 432 BC. The story of Socrates the Philosopher (which literally means a ‘lover of wisdom’, philo meaning to love, and sophia being wisdom), begins at the Oracle at Delphi. Socrates asked the Oracle whether anyone was wiser than he, to which they responded “No”. Perplexed, Socrates set about proving the Oracle wrong by questioning those regarded to be wise. None, to his dismay, stood up to his scrutiny. In questioning these wise men around Athens, Socrates soon developed a following of like-minded philosophers, including Plato. Much of what he discussed concerned the living of a good life; what may be termed today as ethics and morality. Like his teacher Socrates, Plato evidently had pursuits we would not perhaps associate with a philosopher: Plato is actually a nickname, meaning broad, which he was allegedly given because of his broad shoulders and wrestling prowess. Plato is the source of much modern knowledge of Socrates, whose teachings and wisdoms are recorded in his Dialogues. These are, generally, concerned with the search for Truth and its nature, and an understanding of what it is to be Good. His most famous philosophical idea is the Theory of the Forms, explained in his Allegory of the Cave. This argued that ideas existed in a higher realm of truth, and the understanding of something as good, in the human world, corresponded to a reflection of this higher Form of good. The Theory of the Forms is argued in Plato’s Republic, his other famous work. In the Republic, the philosopher outlines his ideas for how to create a perfect society, a utopia; unsurprisingly, the philosophers would be important in this ideal society… There was no happy ending to this tale of a philosophical awakening in Athens. Socrates’ questioning of Athenian customs angered people in the city. With Athenian fortunes on the wane, the city having been devastated by plague and being roundly defeated in the Peloponnesian War, the Athenian’s rounded on Socrates, viewing him as a source of instability. He was famously accused of corrupting the youth of Athens with his philosophy. He was put on trial in 399 BC and found guilty. His punishment was death. Famously, Socrates faced his end with courage, drinking a poisonous concoction that included hemlock. The death of Socrates was recorded by Plato in his Phaedo, and it has inspired artists ever since. His last words were, allegedly, a reminder of his debt to the healing god Asclepius: “Crito, we owe a cockerel to Asclepius”.There’s a good chance that some of you reading this deal with the legacy of these philosophers every day. A lot of modern teaching makes use of the so-called Socratic method. This was outlined in Plato’s dialogues, and it involves the breaking down of a problem into a series of questions, which would allow one to work towards the answer.",

    "phidiasTextDescription": "Phidias was something of a polymath: he was a jack of all trades and seemingly a master of them all too. Born in around 480 BC, this sculptor, painter, and architect was responsible for Athens looking like a city worthy of enjoying a Golden Age. It wasn’t just Athens that benefitted from Phidias’ prodigious artistic talents however, as his endeavours were sought out across the Greek world. Today he is remembered in Art History as a leading figure in the emergence of the Classical style, particularly in terms of sculpture. In Athens, it is generally believed that Phidias was on good terms with the political elite of the 5th century. The biographer Plutarch, writing during the 1st century AD (under the Roman Empire), describes how Phidias had a close friendship with Pericles. The biographer even records the gossip that Phidias was guilty of syphoning money set aside for the Athenian state into his own coffers (although this might well just be gossip). The most famous of Phidias’ work in Athens remains the statue of Athena Parthenos inside the Parthenon, and the Athena Promachos, a colossal bronze statue on the Acropolis, stood between the Parthenon and the Propylaea (the monumental gateway to the hilltop sanctuary). Plutarch likewise suggests that Phidias oversaw the works that were being executed on the Acropolis, including supervising Iktinos and Kallkrates, the architects responsible for the Parthenon itself which was built between 447 and 432 BC.Outside of Athens, Phidias’ name is associated with the Panhellenic sanctuary at Olympia on the Peloponnese. Panhellenic sanctuaries were sacred spaces open to all Greeks, and this one is famous as the site of the Olympic Games which began in the 8th century BC. Here, archaeologists have uncovered Phidias’ workshop. Unusually, they know that this was Phidias’ workshop because he left his name there: a small cup discovered here was inscribed on the base with the words ‘Pheidiou eimi’, or, ‘I belong to Phidias’. In the sanctuary, Phidias achieved immortality as the artist responsible for the Statue of Olympian Zeus. This monumental statue, showing the King of the Gods seated, holding a winged Nike, was famous as one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.",

    "aristophanesAndSophoclesTextDescription": "When looking at the importance of 5th century Athens as a place and time in history, it soon becomes clear that the city took centre stage for a staggering number of developments – political, social, and cultural – which are still significant to this day. Notable amongst these, and an important medium for exploring the politics of the period in particular, is theatre. There was nothing that the citizens of Athens enjoyed more than a trip to the theatre to cry – either tears of joy or sorrow – at the comedies and tragedies that graced the stages in the city.Athens was home to a number of the most famous playwrights in history, including Aeschylus and Euripides. Perhaps the most important however, was Sophocles. Born in around 496, he is responsible for producing some of the most enduring tragedies, may of which are still performed in modern theatres. These plays would typically be performed in competitions as part of religious festivals, such as the Dionysia festival at Athens, before being staged around Greece. Sophocles is known to have been an incredibly prolific playwright, producing around 120 plays. Unfortunately, a great number of these now survive only in fragmentary form. Seven Sophoclean tragedies have survived intact, and these include Oedipus the King, Electra, and Antigone. Many of his plays draw on well-known figures from Greek mythology. They often centred less on what happened, and instead how or why, typically featuring a central hero whose over-confidence and pride (their hubris) leads to a tragic ending for the character and a cautionary tale for the audience. Sophocles is also known to have been an active and important member of the Athenian polis, contributing to the democratic politics of the period. He worked alongside Pericles to quash a revolt on Samos in c.441 BC for instance.When it came to contemporary politics however, it was comedy that focused on the heroes and villains of the present – rather than mythology – most keenly. Few did it better, or with more bite, than Aristophanes. Born in around 460 BC, he is the best-known writer of Comedy from the Ancient Greek world, and he is still celebrated for his uproarious, though perceptive, portrayals of the turbulences of Athenian politics. Not much is known of Aristophanes the man, although he does feature in one of Plato’s dialogues; he is scalded by the philosopher for encouraging the public distrust of Socrates, the victim of Aristophanes’ lampooning (most famously in his play, The Clouds, written in around 423 BC). His grasp of the nature of Athenian politics and his ability to read the pulse of society is suggested by the plots of the plays that have survived however, and some of the most famous confront the Athenian state directly. For example, The Wasps (c. 422 BC) takes aim at the Athenian jury system, whilst the Lysistrata tells the tale of the women of Greece going on a sex strike to compel men to make peace with each other!",

    "demokrataText": "Perhaps the single most significant development that is synonymous with Classical Athens was a political revolution. Traditional ways of political organisation were abandoned, in favour of a new approach. The Athenians decided that instead of serving the interests of a King or a tyrant (a monarchy) or being subject to the whims of a narrow band of aristocrats (an oligarchy), they would instead represent themselves; the people would exercise political control. This was democracy. \n\n Demokratia, democracy, derives from two Greek words: demos, meaning power, and kratos, meaning power. It was politics by people power. The Athenians were not conducting the first ancient experiment in democracy, but it was certainly the most successfule and  by developed at that time.  The Athenian democracy was very different to our own, however. Most modern democracies are representative; we vote to elect individuals to  our interests. Athenian democracy was direct: “everyone” could participate. However, not everyone was eligible. Only adult male citizens could participate. Women (even Athenian women), slaves, and non-Athenians (called metics) could not. \n\n IMAGE:\n\n A terracotta lekythos (oil flask) from the late 6th century (ca. 550-530 BC), attributed to the Amasis painter. The main body of this lekythos depicts a number of women at work, weaving at a loom. Denied political equality within the Athenian democracy, women were typically meant to remain at home, caring for the house. This was often expressed in a number of stereotypical subjects, including weaving. ",

Pious or impious made no difference in their view, when they could see all dying without distinction. As for offences against the law, no one expected to live long enough to brought to justice and pay the penalty: they thought that a much heavier sentence had already been passed and was hanging over them, so that might as well have some enjoyment of life before it fell.” Thucydides, 2.53\n\nIn a gruesomely ironic twist, the plague that ran riot through the streets of ancient Athens in 430 BC served to remind the residents of the pestilential city of the truth of their beliefs. The men of that time were equal, and neither wealth nor status could protect someone from the illness; this disease was truly democratic in the devastation it wrought.\n\nThe passage of Thucydides that details the plague is comparatively brief within the historian’s lengthier narrative of the Peloponnesian War that ravaged the Greek world, but it loses none of its impact for its brevity. The historian is keen to stress how the disease stretched Athenian society to breaking point. In a world where life was short, rules and conventions fell, like the sick, by the roadside. In a pattern that is seen repeated throughout history and across different cultures – especially during the Black Death that ravaged Europe in the Middle Ages - the desperate plight of the Athenians led to a disintegration of the societal norms and rules that had pinned people together. The rampant speed with which the disease spread from person to person contributed to this breakdown, as the city’s population quickly gave up on providing care for either the living or the dead, unable to manage.\n\n“All previously observed funeral customs were confounded and burial was haphazard, any way that people could manage.” Thucydides, 2.52\n\nArchaeologists have uncovered mass graves in Athens, notably outside of the traditional cemetery at Kerameikos. Dating to between 430 and 426 BC the mass grave here is the final resting place of around 240 people, including several children.

Ostracisms could take place once a year, decided in the assembly. It was thought to be a way of protecting the polis from the tyranny of a particular individual, or it could be used to express the citizen’s anger, or indeed, as a useful pre-emptive political tool to neutralise rivals…\n\n A number of notable Athenians were ostracised over the 5th century, included Themistocles, the hero of the Persian Wars; Alcibiades, the leading citizen after Pericles’ death; and even Xanthippus, the father of Pericles!

    "legacyText": "This historical figure of Hippocrates, despite everything that is attributed to him, remains something of a mysterious figure. He did not found a school of medicine per se, nor do many of the treatises attributed to him appear to have been written directly by him. Nevertheless, he is widely regarded as one of the founding fathers of medicine as a discipline.\n\nThis legacy is in part thanks to the work of a Roman doctor, a man called Galen (ca. AD 129-200). Originally from Pergamon (in modern Turkey), Galen travelled around the empire before settling in Rome, where he worked as the court physician for the emperors Marcus Aurelius, and his son and successor, Commodus.\n\nAs a physician, Galen’s understanding of medicine was heavily influenced by the Hippocratic approach, including the theory of the Four Humours. He also studied anatomy, conducting dissections. However, this largely had to be on animals, because human vivisection was still a prohibited taboo; Galen settled for apes and pigs instead, and where possible, he encouraged his students to investigate the corpses of gladiators killed in the arena!\n\nGalen’s approach to medicine, which was recorded in a large number of texts, became central to much medical science for over a millennium, both in Europe and in the Arab world. It would take changes in society and technology to allow Galen’s works to be challenged and developed; it wasn’t until Andreas Vesalius was able to dissect human bodies and reproduce his anatomical drawings and diagrams with the printing press (his book, De humani corporis fabrica – On the fabric of the human body – was published in 1543), that the limitations of Galen’s work (as well as his successes) became more clearly known.\n\nIt is also curious to note that Galen himself likewise lived through a plague that devastated the ancient world. The Antonine Plague, named after the family name of the Roman emperors at the time, devastated the empire between AD 165-168. This disease was likely smallpox, with the descriptions of the symptoms recorded by Galen proving especially valuable to historians.",

    "fourHumorsText": "The most famous medical theory that is often associated with Hippocrates is the idea of the Four Humours. In the absence of a detailed anatomical knowledge of the human body, it was believed that the human body was made up of four humours, which – when in balance – kept a person healthy. An imbalance in these humours was believed to lead to sickness. \n\nIn his interpretation of this approach, Hippocrates suggested that there were four humours, and that these were the vital bodily fluids: blood, phlegm, black bile, yellow bile. An imbalance in these humours would negatively affect the patient. If the imbalance was only mild, then this would affect the patient only in terms of their attitude. If the imbalance was more extreme, then the patient could become sick. This imbalance was referred to as dyscrasia, whilst the balance of the humours was called eucrasia.\n\n“The Human body contains blood, phlegm, yellow bile and black bile. These are the things that make up its constitution and cause its pains and health. Health is primarily that state in which these constituent substances are in the correct proportion to each other, both in strength and quantity, and are well mixed. Pain occurs when one of the substances presents either a deficiency or an excess or is separated in the body and not mixed with others” an extract from On the Nature of Man, one of the medical treatises attributed to Hippocrates.

    "asklepionText": "The ancien t Greeks did not have hospitals in the same way that modern societies do. However, they did have places dedicated to healing. These were the healing sanctuaries of Asclepius, the Asklepions. The Hippocratic approach to medicine was focused more so on prognosis, rather than diagnosis, and this approach is evident in the Asklepions around the Greek world too. They promoted a healthier approach to life, including clean, fresh air. As such, these sanctuaries were often built at secluded areas, usually in the hilly countryside and sometimes with close to thermal springs. Hippocrates himself is said to have received his medical training at the Asklepion at Kos. However, the most famous Asklepion in Greece was at Epidaurus, a small town in southern Greece, not far from the city of Argos. Nature was prominent throughout these sanctuaries, with snakes a common site (due to their association with the god Askelpius), as well as dogs who were often tasked with licking the wounds of patients (an approach to treatment not likely to be too popular with modern doctors!)\n\nDID YOU KNOW\n\nThe ancient Greeks often looked to nature when discussing medicine and health. When describing the plague of Athens, Thucydides offers the rather macabre detail that the disease even drove the birds away from the city. Any of the carrion eaters who braved the flesh of the dead were also said to have died shortly after… \n\n“Here is one particular point in which it showed that it was unlike the usual run of illnesses: the birds and animals which feed on human flesh either kept away from the bodies, although there were many unburied, or if they did taste them it proved fatal. To confirm this, there was an evident shortage of birds of that kind, which were not to be seen either near the victims or anywhere else.” (Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War)\n\nSleep was a very important part of the healing process at the Asklepion. First, patients would undergo a purification process known as Katharsis. This involved several days of good hygiene and bathing, good diet, and other methods of purging. Then, the patient would go to sleep in the special dormitory at the sanctuary, the Abaton or Enkoimeterion, where they would sleep in a hypnotic state. Dreams of visitations by Asclepius and his various daughters would follow, and the gods would reveal to the patients their prognosis. When they woke, the priests at the sanctuaries – master dream interpreters – would help the patient make sense of what they had experienced. \n\nOften, people who visited the Asklepions would dedicate offerings in the shape of the body part that was ailing them. These votive pieces – which could take the form of arms, feet and various other anatomical parts – would have been something of a token of gratitude to the healing god. They are often recovered by archaeologists at these sites, alongside a variety of medical and surgical instruments.",

Doctors in the ancient Greek world, including Hippocrates – the “Father of Medicine” – were often referred to as Asclepiads, in recognition of their work being under the auspices of the god. \n\nAsclepius had a number of children, the names of which have given us a number of words that are now commonly associated with medicine and health. The most notable of these are his daughters: Hygieia (the goddess of cleanliness) and Panacea (the goddess of a universal remedy). These have obviously evolved into the words hygiene and panacea (which still means a universal remedy, or cure all).\n\nAsclepius is often easily identified in ancient artworks thanks to his holding the asklpeian, a rod entwined with snakes. This symbol is still closely associated with medicine and hospitals in modern societies. To the ancient Greeks, snakes were closely associated with wisdom and healing, and in one myth a snake is said to have licked Asclepius’ ears clean and imparted on him the knowledge of medicine.\n\nDID YOU KNOW\n\nAsclepius was said to have been trained in the arts of healing by the centaur Chiron.

He lived during the Athenian Golden Age, a witness to Pericles’ Athens, the Peloponnesian War, and of course, the Plague of Athens. Little is known of Hippocrates’ actual biography, much of which was written long after his death, but his impact on medicine remains profound.\n\nAs a doctor, Hippocrates greatest convtribution was the idea that the diseases were caused naturally, rather than the product of superstition and the gods. This separation of medicine from religion was significant. It meant that the cause of illnesses could be searched for in the way people lived (their diets etc) and where they lived. The Hippocratic approach to music therefore was focused on prognosis, not diagnosis: the focus was on the care of the patient. Doctors following this process would be encouraged to observe a patient’s symptoms. Treatments would be based on these observations.\n\nThis is obviously very different to modern medicine. Today, the emphasis is on a specific diagnosis and a specialised treatment. However, we should remember that the understanding of anatomy at this time was very poor. Dissection was not allowed, so the internal workings of the human body were largely a mystery. \n\nHippocratic medicine was also significant for its professionalism; a Hippocratic doctor was exclusively that. He – and it would invariably be a male doctor – followed strict rules regarding his practice, especially with regard to observing and recording information about their patients. ",

A form of this is still used by doctors in the modern world, and it is an ethic oath taken to express a doctor’s commitment to caring for the patient to the best of their abilities and to not cause harm.\nThe original oath, made by Hippocrates, exists only on partial fragments of papyrus, recovered from Egypt and dating to around AD 275 (almost 700 years after Hippocrates had practiced medicine!). This oath, or variants of it at least, are though to be the earliest expression of medical ethics in the western world, and many of the principles are still applicable to modern medicine.

Apollo was a traditional healing god in the ancient Greek pantheon, whilst Asclepius was also soon recognised around the Greek world as a god of healing and medicine, as indicated by the spread of Asklepions as places of healing. \nThis religious aspect of the Hippocratic Oath also makes clear the debt that modern medical terminology owes to these ancient Greek ideals. It includes two of the Ascleptiadae, the sons and daughters of Asclepius. Hygieia, from whom the English word ‘hygiene’ is derived, was the goddess of health and cleanliness, whilst Panacea was a goddess of universal cure or remedy (the word ‘panacea’ still refers to a universal cure in modern terminology). Their siblings – not mentioned in this version of the oath – were Iaso (goddess of recuperation); Aceso (the goddess of the healing process); and Algaia. Notably, whilst Asclepius and Panacea may be more closely associated with the treatment of diseases, Hygieia was associated with the initial prevention of illness. \nMuch like her mythological father, Hygieia is remembered today in common pharmacological and medical iconography. The ‘bowl of Hygieia’ symbol is used around the world (especially Europe) to indicate medical care, and shows a snake entwined around the stem of a cup or chalice.",

As a democracy, Athens had complex systems of legislation and organisation, there was no central authority on medicine or health, meaning that the onus was on the individual doctor(s).\nThe Oath does not, it must be said, suggest professionalism in the same sense as it is found in modern societies. Nevertheless, by swearing this oath – with its deeply religious tone established at the start (1) – the ancient medical practitioners are demonstrated to submitting their work to a higher power and a standard of care. Moreover, that the gods invoked at the start were recognisable to the people they were helping gave further weight to the oath and its meaning; the doctors were bound to the same gods as the patients, and everyone knew the potential perils involved in reneging on an agreement with the gods, as is emphasised by the warning at the end of the Oath.\nAfter all, there were some who believed that the Plague of Athens itself was a sign that the god Apollo had abandoned the city and lent his support to the Spartans…\n“And in their distress they recalled, as was natural, the following prophecy which their older men said had long ago been uttered:\n‘A Dorian war shall come, and pestilence with it’…” (Thucydides 2.54)",

This could include the environment in which one lived and worked, as well as what people ate. This approach is explicitly referred to in the Oath here, with the reference to dietary regimens as a way of treating a patient. These practices are also clear from the healing sanctuaries, the Asklpeions, where patients could retreat from a bustling polis to the quiet and calm of the Greek countryside.\n“Men regard its nature and cause [i.e., of diseases] as divine from ignorance and wonder” Hippocrates, On the Sacred Disease. This is one of the texts contained within the so-called Hippocratic Corpus, written about 400 BC. Although it is typically attributed to Hippocrates himself, the actual author remains unconfirmed and some approach the text with a healthy amount of scepticism.

In more modern versions of the Hippocratic Oath, one can find this principle expressed in the term “First, do no harm” (or sometimes in Latin: primum non nocere). This is a much later expression, but as is clear from this papyrus document, the principle existed even in antiquity.\nThe refusal to harm patients could result in some quandaries for ancient doctors. The role of surgery appears to have been troublesome for instance. In a world without anaesthetics and antiseptics, invasive surgery would almost certainly be fatal, with patients dying of shock, blood-loss, and, if they survived that, probably infection. However, the express commitment not to use the knife on patients in the Oath contrasts with other texts in the Hippocratic Corpus (a collection of writings attributed, not without debate, to Hippocrates). These texts for instance provide guidance on how to perform some small operations, particularly for the removal of kidney and gallstones (Lithomoy). The Oath, as it is preserved here, explicitly states that such procedures should be left to “craftsmen” (i.e., surgeons) who are qualified to carry out these procedures.\nNotably, the text of the Oath preserved on this papyrus also refers to abortion, and explicitly prohibits it. This again is in contradiction to an earlier Hippocratic text, which describes a procedure without any suggestion that it was morally wrong.",

    "athenianDefeatText": "In the aftermath of Athens’ defeat and the recovery from the devastation wrought by both war and plague, the political landscape of the city fractured.\nAt first, democracy was a victim. Despite enduring through the year of plague, it had increasingly found starting to creak under the strain of war. In 406 BC for example, the Athenian navy had rallied, defeating the Spartans at the Battle of Arginusae. The failure of the commanders to capitalise on this victory however (through no fault of their own, merely bad weather), led to a trial in Athens at which six leading naval commanders were executed. This would severely undermine the capacity of the Athenian forces in future. \nBy a quirk of fortune, Socrates was holding public office at the time of this trial - the only time in his entire life. He was serving as an epistates, who fulfilled an executive function within the Boule. Although both Plato and the historian Xenophon records that Socrates declared that he would “do nothing contrary to the law”, factionalism and political maneuvering in the Athenian democracy led to all six commanders being unable to avoid their fate.\nQUOTE\n“At that time I was the only one who opposed doing anything contrary to the laws, and although the orators were ready to impeach and arrest me… I thought I must run the risk to the end with law and justice on my side, rather than join with you when your wishes were unjust, through fear of imprisonment or death” Socrates, recorded by Plato Apology 32b-c.",

    "timeOfTyrantsText": "When the Athenians eventually surrendered to the Spartans in 404 BC, the democratic system of government was suspended. Instead, a reactionary regime of ‘Thirty Tyrants’ was set up, led by Critias. This group of oligarchs reduced the rights of many Athenian citizens, limiting participation in government to 3,000 selected men. Critias had actually once been a pupil or associate of Socrates, and this would have repercussions for the philosopher later… The reign of the Thirty Tyrants was notable for its violence and rapacity, with wealthy Athenians often put on trial on trumped up charges and executed, simply so that their assets could be stripped. The violence of these oligarchs quelled resistance until in 403 they were overthrown by an uprising led by an exiled Athenian, Thrasybulus.\nSocrates was one of the notable Athenians who chose to remain in the city under the control of the Thirty Tyrants, and this, coupled with his known association with Critias, led to his coming under increased scrutiny. It also did not help that Socrates’ teachings, and later those of Plato, were often critical of democracy as a form of political organization, nor that he had been close to Alcibiades, the general in charge of the Sicilian expedition who was recalled and removed before the disastrous expedition even left.",

    "deathPhilosopherText": "He was put on trial in 399 BC, charged with impiety against the Athenian gods and with corrupting the youth of Athens through his teachings. The trial and its aftermath are documented by the historian Xenophon, and in several of the dialogues of Plato, particularly in the Apology of Socrates. Athenian trials had juries drawn from the citizen body by lots, often with a hundred or more jurors. Found guilty of his crimes (but not by an overwhelming majority), several punishments were suggested. Finally, the death sentence was proposed and passed through a vote (by a greater majority than had initially voted him guilty – some of Socrates’ responses had evidently angered the jurors…)\nAlthough his associates encouraged the philosopher to flee Athens, Socrates declined. Abiding until the end by the maxim of civic obedience to the law – the principal he had so often taught – Socrates faced his death. At the age of 70, and with his disciples gathered around, the philosopher drank a concoction that contained the poison hemlock. His courage in the face of death, and his commitment to his principles, provided the final lesson of a life lived in pursuit of knowledge, and serves as a fitting conclusion to the breakdown of a society in the face of war and disease.",

    "theSicilianExpeditionText": "The Peloponnesian War ebbed and flowed over the years, even arriving at a temporary intermission in 423 BC with the Peace of Nicias. Named for the Athenian general who had brokered it, it was meant to be a 50-year peace treaty: it lasted for 8! The war resumed in 415 BC, and a decisive blow was struck, not in Greece, but in Sicily. Athenian allies in Sicily sent requests to Athens for support against increasing clashes against the people of Syracuse (allies of Sparta). Athenian politics was split; one side, led by Nicias (who had brokered the fragile peace) warned that Athenian intervention would be interpreted as aggression; the other, led by Alcibiades, saw this as the opportune moment for the Athenians to score a victory against Spartan power.\nThucydides suggests that Nicias requested a larger force for the Athenian invasion, hoping to illustrate to the assembly instead that their goal was impossible. Instead, the opposite happened. Athens mobilised an extraordinarily large force and set out for Sicily. The vicissitudes of Athenian democracy were evident from the start, with Alcibiades, the leader of the expedition, summoned back on to Athens before the fleet had even departed. Despite the early successes of the Athenians, the Syracusans were soon bolstered by the arrival of their Spartan allies, led by Gylippus. The Athenians attempted to double-down on their setbacks with disastrous consequences. The nadir was reached when attempting a last-ditch evacuation of Syracuse: almost the entire expeditionary force was lost, either destroyed or captured by the Sicilians and sold into slavery.",

Their fate had effectively been sealed by a Spartan alliance with the Persians, which helped sow rebellion in the Athenian Empire, as well as providing the Spartans with the materials needed to pursue a naval campaign against the Athenians. Despite a string of naval victories over the next decade, the Athenian fleet was obliterated at the Battle of Aegospotami in 405 BC. By 404, the Spartan general Lysander was besieging the city of Athens itself. Inevitably, the city surrendered. \nThus ended the Golden Age of Athens. To their credit, the Spartans rejected the calls from their Corinthian and Theban allies to destroy the defeated city of Athens (although Lysander did oversee the destruction of the Long Walls).",

The city of Thebes rose in the 4th century as a rival and, led by Epaminodas, they crushed Spartan power at the battle of Leuctra in 371 BC, The rise of Macedonian power with Philip II and later his son, Alexander (who would go on to be ‘Great’) in the later 4th century would effectively end the rivalry between Athens and Sparta.",
